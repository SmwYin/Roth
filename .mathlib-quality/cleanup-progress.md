# Roth cleanup progress

Started: 2026-10-14 (America/Chicago).

## Scope and preservation

- Work in the existing checkout, on `ramin-cleanup`, created from local `main` at
  `d2eb5e9a1806e12e66db25d15d8954ade4be9874`.
- The working tree was clean at entry; the previous branch, `ramin-edits`, remains intact.
- Preserve mathematical meaning, theorem contracts, and the pinned Lean/mathlib versions.
- Validate, commit, and push each completed declaration cleanup before proceeding.
- No pushes to `main`, force pushes, or merges.

## Current status

Build/tool setup completed; GitHub browser authentication and branch publication succeeded. The first file audit
(`Roth/HasseDeriv.lean`, 26 declarations) is in progress. The first declaration, `MvPolynomial.hasseCoeff`, has completed its declaration audit and validation; 1 of 264 declarations reviewed. File-level final review and profiling remain pending.

The first `lake build` installed Lean v4.34.0 and fetched the pinned dependencies.
It was deliberately interrupted during dependency compilation to fetch mathlib's
precompiled cache. After cache installation, `lake build` passed with exit code 0 (2,586 jobs).
`lake build Roth.LeanEval` also passed with exit code 0 (2,585 jobs), covering the
verification module absent from root imports.

GitHub CLI 2.102.0 is installed at `~/.local/bin/gh` (official macOS arm64 release,
SHA-256 verified). Browser authentication succeeded as `rtakloo`; Git uses HTTPS credentials
managed by GitHub CLI. Initial setup commit `0d7c74c` was pushed successfully to
[`ramin-cleanup`](https://github.com/SmwYin/Roth/tree/ramin-cleanup).
The earlier HTTPS credential failure and connected-app HTTP 403 are resolved by this local
CLI authentication. No token is stored in this repository.

The active file audit and declaration results are recorded in
[`cleanup/HasseDeriv.md`](cleanup/HasseDeriv.md). Each completed declaration's report and
source change are committed and pushed together after validation.

## Installed tooling and verification

| Component | Installed location/version | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mathlib-quality skill | `~/.codex/skills/mathlib-quality` | Instructions and references readable |
| mathlib-quality full workflow | `~/.local/share/roth-mathlib-quality`, commit `d927d3cacf78a74a80bb3ba044d2352a1c5a447e` | Cleanup command and dependency instructions inspected |
| lean4 skill | `~/.codex/skills/lean4` | Instructions and references readable |
| lean4 helper runtime | `~/.local/share/roth-lean4-skills`, commit `b6243b85b9b0a0ddff5bb6773889044daf687f8e` | Sorry analyzer ran: 14 files scanned, zero sorries |
| Lean | `leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0` | Installed by elan; Lake compiled dependency modules |
| uv | 0.13.1 | Installed; successfully installed the LSP tool and Python runtime |
| Python for LSP | 3.12.15, uv-managed | MCP client probe runs |
| lean-lsp-mcp | 0.31.0 | Version and discovery passed (22 tools). Local search, file diagnostics, and code execution succeeded. Remote Loogle and LeanFinder requests succeeded; LeanSearch returned HTTP 500. Not all 22 tools have been individually tested. |
| GitHub CLI | 2.102.0 | Browser authentication and branch push succeeded |
| ask_chatgpt_math | Skipped | Optional, as authorized |

The Lean LSP server is configured in `~/.codex/config.toml` using its absolute executable
path. It is not registered in this session's tool list. A direct stdio MCP client is
available for testing and use in this session. Host registration must be checked after
a new session/restart. The first 45-second diagnostic request timed out; a retry with
a 180-second limit completed successfully. A shutdown event-loop warning was emitted after
the successful response and did not invalidate the diagnostics. Skills should be discoverable on the next turn; their instructions
can already be read directly. The installed workflow repositories contain 24 mathlib-quality command files, 12 lean4 command files, and 21 lean4 helper wrappers. These counts describe installed files, not individually tested functions. Claude-specific slash commands and hooks are not installed.
The built-in Claude `/simplify` pass will be adapted to an independent review with the same
reuse, quality, and efficiency checks; unavailable capabilities will be recorded explicitly.

## File queue

The initial source inventory contains 264 declarations across 14 files (5,132 lines).
Files will be processed in dependency order; declarations within each file are sequential.

| File | Initial lines | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Roth/HasseDeriv.lean` | 329 | In progress: 1/26 declarations reviewed |
| `Roth/Box.lean` | 128 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/Wronskian.lean` | 271 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/Taylor.lean` | 239 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/CoeffNorm.lean` | 320 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/GenWronskian.lean` | 292 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/Lattice.lean` | 217 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/Index.lean` | 275 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/Separation.lean` | 618 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/Theta.lean` | 981 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/MainLemma.lean` | 704 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/Main.lean` | 684 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth/LeanEval.lean` | 60 | Awaiting cleanup |
| `Roth.lean` | 14 | Awaiting cleanup |

## Completed declarations

| Declaration | Change | Validation | Report |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MvPolynomial.hasseCoeff` | Eta-reduced the defining function; unchanged signature and mathematical meaning | Definitional equality by `rfl`; complete LSP diagnostics, zero errors; full `lake build` and separate `lake build Roth.LeanEval` passed | [Declaration audit](cleanup/HasseDeriv-hasseCoeff.md) |

## Validation and deferrals

- `lake exe cache get`: exit 0; 8,908 cached dependency files downloaded/decompressed.
- Baseline `lake build`: exit 0; 2,586 jobs. Full compiler output: `cleanup-baseline.log`.
- `lake build Roth.LeanEval`: exit 0; 2,585 jobs (separate verification module).
- Lean LSP diagnostics on `Roth/Box.lean`: complete, 0 errors, 21 existing warnings.
- Source `sorry` scan: passed (14 files, zero findings).
- First declaration: post-edit LSP diagnostics completed, zero errors and the existing header warning. Full downstream builds passed (2,586 jobs and 2,585 jobs respectively). Its equivalence and axiom probes passed; see the declaration audit.
- Deferred: a possible generalization of `hasseCoeff` from finitely supported `k` to an arbitrary function was tested but not applied because it changes the public definition signature.
- File-level profiling and final project verification remain pending.
